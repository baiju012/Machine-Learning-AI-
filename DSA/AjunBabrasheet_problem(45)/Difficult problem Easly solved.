By architecture and diagram so that easly understand.


Pascal's Trangle:
The triangle starts with a 1 at the top, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it
Each row of the triangle corresponds to the coefficients of the binomial expansion of (a + b)^n, where n is the row number (starting from 0). For example, the fourth row (1 3 3 1) corresponds to the expansion of (a + b)^3, which is a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3.

Set Matrix Zeros
One way to solve the problem is to use two arrays to keep track of the rows and columns that contain a zero. Then, iterate through the matrix and mark the corresponding row or column in the arrays if a zero is found. Finally, iterate through the matrix again and set any element to zero if its row or column was marked in the arrays
This solution has a time complexity of O(mn), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the matrix. It also has a space complexity of O(m + n) for the two arrays.

WE WILL START VERY SOON.
I left from 15 april to 30 april now.
